	<p>In Informatics, dummy data is benign information that does not

		testing and operational purposes. For testing, dummy data can also be
		used as stubs or pad to avoid software testing issues by ensuring that
		all variables and data fields are occupied. In operational use, dummy
		data may be transmitted for OPSEC purposes. Dummy data must be
		rigorously evaluated and documented to ensure that it does not cause

	<p>In 1956, the German informatician Karl Steinbuch coined the word
		Informatik, publishing a paper called Informatik: Automatische
		Informationsverarbeitung ("Informatics: Automatic Information
		Processing").[13] The morphology—informat-ion + -ics—uses "the
		accepted form for names of sciences, as conics, mathematics,
		linguistics, optics, or matters of practice, as economics, politics,
		tactics",[14] and so, linguistically, the meaning extends easily to
		encompass both the science of information and the practice of
		information processing. The German word Informatik is usually
		translated to English as[15] computer science by universities or
		computer science & engineering by technical universities (German
		equivalents for institutes of technology). Depending on the context,
		informatics is also translated into computing, scientific computing or
		information and computer technology. The French term informatique was
		coined in 1962 by Philippe Dreyfus.[16] In the same month was also
		proposed independently by Walter F. Bauer (1924–2015) and associates
		who co-founded software company Informatics Inc. The term for the new
		discipline quickly spread throughout Europe, but it did not catch on
		in the United States. Over the years, many different definitions of
		informatics have been developed, most of them claim that the essence
		of informatics is one of these concepts: information processing,
		algorithms, computation, information, algorithmic processes,
		computational processes or computational systems.[17][1] The earliest
		uses of the term informatics in the United States was during the 1950s
		with the beginning of computer use in healthcare.[18] Early
		practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no
		formal education programs, and none emerged until the late 1960s.
		Unfortunately, they introduced the term informatics only in the
		context of archival science, which is only a small part of
		informatics. Professional development, therefore, played a significant
		role in the development of health informatics.[18] According to Imhoff
		et al., 2001, healthcare informatics is not only the application of
		computer technology to problems in healthcare, but covers all aspects
		of generation, handling, communication, storage, retrieval,
		management, analysis, discovery, and synthesis of data information and
		knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare. Furthermore, they stated
		that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as
		follows: To provide solutions for problems related to data,
		information, and knowledge processing. To study general principles of
		processing data information and knowledge in medicine and
		healthcare.[19][20] The term health informatics quickly spread
		throughout the United States in various forms such as nursing
		informatics, public health informatics or medical informatics.
		Analogous terms were later introduced for use of computers in various
		fields, such as business informatics, forest informatics, legal
		informatics etc. Unfortunately, these fields still mainly use term
		informatics in context of library science. See also: Library science

		In the English-speaking world, the term informatics was first widely
		used in the compound medical informatics, taken to include "the
		cognitive, information processing, and communication tasks of medical
		practice, education, and research, including information science and
		the technology to support these tasks".[23] Many such compounds are
		now in use; they can be viewed as different areas of "applied
		informatics". Informatics as information processing science See also:
		Cognitive Science § Namings In the early 1990s, K.K. Kolin proposed an
		interpretation of informatics as a fundamental science that studies
		information processes in nature, society, and technical systems.[21] A
		broad interpretation of informatics, as "the study of the structure,
		algorithms, behaviour, and interactions of natural and artificial
		computational systems," was introduced by the University of Edinburgh
		in 1994. This has led to the merger of the institutes of computer
		science, artificial intelligence and cognitive science into a single
		School of Informatics in 2002.[24] More than a dozen nearby
		universities joined Scottish Informatics and Computer Science
		Alliance. Some non-European universities have also adopted this
		definition (e.g. Kyoto University School of Informatics). In 2003,
		Yingxu Wang popularized term cognitive informatics, described as
		follows:[25] Supplementary to matter and energy, information is the
		third essence for modeling the world. Cognitive informatics focuses on
		internal information processing mechanisms and the natural
		intelligence of the brain. Informatics as a fundamental science of
		information in natural and artifficial systems was proposed again in
		Russia in 2006.[26] In 2007, the influential book Decoding the
		Universe was published. Former president of Association for Computing
		Machinery, Peter Denning wrote in 2007:[27] The old definition of
		computer science - the study of phenomena surrounding computers - is
		now obsolete. Computing is the study of natural and artificial
		information processes. The 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, of the
		UK Funding Councils, includes a new, Computer Science and Informatics,
		unit of assessment (UoA),[28] whose scope is described as follows: The
		UoA includes the study of methods for acquiring, storing, processing,
		communicating and reasoning about information, and the role of
		interactivity in natural and artificial systems, through the
		implementation, organisation and use of computer hardware, software
		and other resources. The subjects are characterised by the rigorous
		application of analysis, experimentation and design. In 2008, the
		construction of the Informatics Forum was completed. In 2018, the MIT
		Schwarzman College of Computing was established. Its construction is
		planned to be completed in 2021.</p>
