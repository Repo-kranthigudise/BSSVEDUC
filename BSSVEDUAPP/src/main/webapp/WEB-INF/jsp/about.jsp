	<b>Bharat Sevak Samaj</b>
	<p>Bharath Sevak Samaj is the National Development Agency sponsored
		by the Planning Commission, Government of India to ensure public
		co-operationfor implementing government plants. The main purpose
		behind the formulation of Bharat Sevak Samaj is to initiate a nation
		wide, non official and non political organization with the object of
		enabling individual citizens to contribute, in the form of an
		organized co-operative effort, to the implementation of the National
		Development Plan. The constitution and functioning of Bhart Sevak
		Samaj is approved unanimously by the Indian Parliament.
	<p>
		<b>JAWAHARLAL NEHRU MESSAGE</b>
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>We can to some extent measure our resources or most of them. But
		it is very difficult to measure the biggest of these resources that we
		have, that is man-power, and that psychology which makes people work
		for greater ends. Unless we utilize this man-power and unless we can
		produce that temper in our people which laughs at difficulties and
		gets things done, sometimes inspite of facts, we cannot achieve
		anything really big. The proposal to start organization to be called
		the Bharat Sevak Samaj, has this in view. It is an ambitions for it,
		not the ambition for little and personal things of life but the
		ambition to serve great causes, forgetting one self and achieve great
		ends. This is not a political organization, even though, I, a
		politician, commend it. It is meant for every able bodied men and
		women, whatever his views might be on other topics‚Äù.</p>
	<p>
		<b>A MISSION AND A MOVEMENT</b>
	</p>

	<p>Bharat Sevak Samaj is a mission and a movement. To succeed as
		such, it must win the adherence and support of a large and growing
		number of people in the country, that can come about only on the
		strengof a genuine understanding of the purpose and significance of
		the new organisation. To furnish an answer to the question: "Why Bhart
		Sevak Samaj"?, it shall restate the major assumption underlying the
		conception of the Samaj. First there is a great deal of necessary,
		good and useful work remain to be done in the aountry, for which no
		provision may be made, in the normal course, for many years. To
		accomplish this, special effort on a very large scale is needed, which
		is not yet in evidence. Scondly, the means for carrying out such a
		programme on a large scale are available in the shape of the unused
		time, energy and other resources, accompanied by the desire or urge on
		the part of may people to give for the service of the community.
		Thirdly, in view of the variety and magnitude of the activity, an
		organisation has to be built up, which has to be big and strong enough
		to cope with these great tasks. It should be capableof mobilizing the
		voluntary efforts of the people and make effective and fruitful use of
		it. Such organisation does not exist.</p>
	<p>In a community which has attainned such a state These basic
		assumptions explain the origin of the Bhart Sevak Samaj. Theyare as
		true and meaningful today as some years ago, whenthe first decision to
		establish the organisation was taken. The meaning may perphas, with
		advantage, be brought out a little more fully.</p>
	<p>In a community which has attained such a state of abundance that
		to everybody all the means of naterial well - being are available,
		voluntary service might not have a definite role. The view, however,
		does not take account of the vast tange of intagible service which,
		even in these circumstances, people can render to one another in the
		realm of moral and spiritual satisfaction. But that time has not yet
		come any where in any part of the world and is not likely to arrive in
		this country for many years.</p>
	<p>In fact, India, judging by her per capita income, stands almost
		at the bottom among the nations of the world. On the basis of
		available statistics India is lagging behind. There are thus bound to
		be large gaps in material well-being for the bulk of our people which
		should be visible to anyone who is in touch with the villages or the
		towns of India.</p>
	<p>Insanitary sorroundings, low standards of essential amenities,
		lack of facilities for community life in most places, are facts which
		themselves point to possibilities of constructive activity in numerous
		directions. Many of these things will, for the time being, not be
		figuting in the Governments's plants and are often beyond the reach of
		individual initative or resources. There are various other
		consequences of poverty and ignorance which must be combated by social
		enlightenment and action. In the field of social relations and the
		rebuilding of the social order, there are so many important task which
		are being neglected at present.</p>
	<p>At the same time, as all of us know, there are vast numbers of
		person who have unused or spareenergy and time at their disposal which
		could easily be directed into useful channels to fill many of these
		gaps. Take our villages; the normalavocations of the people and the
		claims of helthy recreation do not absorb all the time that is
		available. This idle time can, with the help of some auxiliary
		resources, be quickly converted into roads, tanks, community centres
		etc.</p>
	<p>If we assume that an hour a day on the average shoul thus be
		pressed into voluntary services in respect of half the population of
		the country, we can tap this reservior immensely for the betterment of
		nation.There are, besides, classes of people, who may have much more
		time to to give to useful volumntary activity if the idea appeals to
		them. There is a large class of those who have retired from service.
		They can bring to bear on this programme of voluntary activity a fund
		of experience. In this country there is also a fairly large number of
		those who renounce the world. As far as personal ends are concerned,
		but on the very account they are in a position to dedicate themselves
		wholly to the service of humanity. The vacation time of students
		could, in part, be utilized for social purposes.</p>
	<p>These large resources can, however, be drawn up actually only to
		the exent that the urge to seve others exists or can be created. It is
		our experience that the urge exists on a considerable scale, and
		amounts up to high levels when occasionsarise which make a strong
		appeal to the mind. Volunteers are not lacking in national
		emergencies. This urge for unselfish service is as much an abiding
		element of human nature as its self-regarding aspects. It can be
		nourished and strengthened. In our country which has just achieved
		Independence, mainly by dint of the sufferings and sacrifices of the
		common men and women. the spring of unselfish action is evidently
		there in plenty. There is also a good deal of impatience with the pace
		of our advance in talking the serious social and economic problems of
		the nation. The aspiration to make India a great and strong country is
		shared by vast numbers. These are counditions which offer wide
		opportunities for moving the hearts of the people, releasing their
		latent powers and enlisting them for the constructive task which are
		waiting to be done. Once this kind of climate and utlook are created,
		voluntary social service will rise high in the scale of priorities
		which are established in people's minds for the expenditure of their
		time and resources. Time which was supposed to be taken up in other
		pursuits, will now become free for acts of service. And not only time
		and talents, but also the material counterpart in cash and kind will
		be forthecoming in large measures. The poorest in our land have
		something to give by way of charity.</p>
	<p>These resources are there but no good can come out of them
		unless they are harnessed. Such large volumes of water flow in our
		mighty rivers are carried down to the sea without yielding the
		benefirts, which they can bring to the people. To prevent this waste,
		we have to make dams, reserviors and canals. The tapping of vast
		reserves of the nation's time and energy necessarily entails high
		feats of social engineering. An organisation, capable of dealing with
		the big tasks which arises, has to be set up. The tasks are many and
		varied. Programmes to meet national and local needs have to be worked
		our. They should be carried and explained to the people in every
		village and town of India. Voluntary effort has to be stimulated and
		mobilized on a nation-wide basis. Volunteers should be enlisted,
		traned and assigned suitable tasks. Leadership should be developed at
		various level by proper selection and courcses training. Equipment,
		technical guidance and various services have to be provided. Efficient
		and honest use has to be ensured of the resources available, whatever
		the source from which they are derived. There should be adequate
		supervision. A proper system of accounts, audit, records, Reports and
		returns should be brought into force. For this a network of agencies
		has to grow up, which should work on a decentralized basis but in a
		co-ordinated manner. When the number of those engaged in different
		activities grows and the atrea of operation extends, machinery at
		various levels has to be set up for taking decisions, issuing
		directions and securing observance of rules of discipline. In this
		entire set up precautions must be introduced so that standards of
		performance do not go down and the organisation is not undermined by
		tendencies to intrigues, factionalism and exploitation of any kind.
		When the idea of forming an organisation on these lines took shape, it
		was found that the functions set out here were not being discharged to
		any appreciable extend and no institution existed, which was designed
		to or capable of assuming respensibilities of this order.</p>
	<p>Bharat Sevak Samaj was thus brought into being. But it has been
		from the outset stressed that the formation of the Samaj should not
		lead to any duplication of efforts or overlapping of activities. All
		agencies working in this field should collaborate and by mutual help
		greatly enhance the range and effectiveness of the entire programme of
		constructive voluntary activity in the country. Samaj can become a
		focal centre for such collaboration.</p>

	<p>
		<b>A. Five Principles for Part-Time Workers</b>
	</p>
	<p>Whereas Bharat Sevak Samaj in course of its existence of has
		followed its accepted principles of service and sacrifice in all its
		programmes and activities and has advanced considerably towards its
		objectives. It is felt that time come when Bharat Sevak Samaj should
		follow the following 5 principles of work:</p>
	<p>1. Obedience to all the rules of the organization as they are in
		force and as they will be from time to time. 2. Obedience to all
		lawful instructions from the superiors in position and the management
		with due respect. 3. Work according to the system of work prevailing
		in this organization. 4. Exactitude in work and not slipshod work,
		causing mistakes and misunderstanding, thereby reducing the quality of
		work. 5. Efficiency in work, which includes speed, and not haste in
		work.</p>
	<p>Bharat Sevak Samaj should aim at maintaining discipline among
		its workers. Its rules, its procedure of selection etc should be such
		as to enable it to train its workers into systematic, efficient,
		disciplined and devoted workers for the nation.</p>
	<p>
		<b>B. Seven Primnciples for Full-Time Workers</b>
	</p>
	<p>Whereas Bharat Sevak Samaj has made considerable progress in the
		course of its life of about a decade in the execution of its
		programmes, whith the co-operation and assistance of its workers, it
		is felt that time has now come when all its full-time workers should
		follow meticulously the following seven principles for advancing The
		objectives of the organisation:-</p>
	<p>i. No link between work and wages its workers. The workers
		should not be allowed to sell their services for remuneration.
		Instead, they should be encouraged to work in the spirit of "Karma
		Youga" and in the interest of the national productivity and welfare of
		humanity in general. In keeping with these priniciples, the work done
		by workers of tjis organization should be completely free and no
		consideration should be paid for the work that they do, neither in
		cash nor in kind, nor in name, fame or any other kind of
		self-satisfation. The motto in this organisation should be "Service is
		Sacrifice". ii. Remunaration should be given for the Five needs of
		life namely, Nutrition, Shelter, Clothing, Health and Education, and
		Miscellaneous Necessities only for the worker himself and a limited
		number of justifiable dependants - the present number being not more
		than three and to the extent to which it is not available from other
		sources. This provision should be made because it should be our
		article of faith that every human being has a birth-right over the
		"Needs of Life" by virtue of his being born in this world and not
		beacuse he is a worker or is able to earn in other ways. The workers
		should be discouraged from satisfying their desire beyond the "Needs
		and Necessities" upto the optimum standard as mentioned above, until
		such time as all the human being are able to receive the wherewithals
		for the "Five Needs of Life" in our country at least. iii. Obedience
		to all the rules of the organisation as they are in force and as they
		will be from time. iv. Obedience to all lawful instructions from the
		superiors in position and the management with due respect. v. Work
		accourding to the systems of work prevailing in this organisation. vi.
		Exactitude in work, and not slipshod work, causing mistakes and
		misunderstanding, therby reducing the quality of work. vii. Efficiency
		in work, which includes speed, and not haste, in work.</p>
	<p>Bhart Sevak Samaj should aim at maintaining discipline among its
		workers. Its rules, its procedure of selection, etc, should be such as
		to enable its workers into systematic, efficient, disciplines, and
		decoted workers for the nation.</p>
	<p>
		<b>C. Seven-Point Programme for National Defence</b>
	</p>
	<p>1. Assistance to the families of the Military Personnel</p>
	<p>i. Collections in cash and kind for the purpose of such
		assistance. ii. To arrange visits to families and extend are and help.
	</p>
	<p>2. Maintenance of the morale and solidarity of the community</p>
	<p>i. To disseminate correct information and counteract false
		rumours. ii. To educate the people regarding the situation and its
		implications. iii. To foster unity in the community and to prevent and
		remove tensions. iv. To create a strong sentiment and consciousness of
		responsiblity in every citizen to do his duty to the nation
		transecending all other liyalties and be prepared for the necessary
		sacrifices. v. Taking of pledges for self-denial in one form or the
		other.</p>
	<p>
		<b>3. To provide construction agency for the needs of Defence</b>
	</p>
	<p>The Bharat Sevak Samaj Construction Service will create special
		construction corps for taking up construction activity in difficult
		areas for the purpose of Defence.</p>
	<p>
		<b>4. Assistance in the Prevention of rise in prices</b> i. To set up
		consumer stores and to enlist voluntary workers and to train workers
		for this purpose. ii. To organize active vigilance to prevent and
		combat black-marketing, hoarding, profiteering and other
		mal-practices. iii. Propaganda for austerity, restraint on consumption
		especially in respect of imported articles and elimination of waste
		particularly in regard to foodgrains. People to be taught to restrict
		purchases to the barest minimum. iv. Campaign to start through the Lok
		Karya Keshetras and other agencies of the Samaj, for stepping up
		agricultural production to the utmost extent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>5. Bhart Sevak Dal to render emergency service</b>
	</p>
	<p>To organize special corps of volunteer to be called the Bharat
		Sevak Dal for rendering service in emergencies and necessary help to
		the community, wherever required and arrange for the necessary
		training and equipment for the purpose.</p>
	<p>1. To Mobilize the savings of the community and to induce people
		to invest in small savings. 2. To collaborate and assist the various
		committees that may be formed at the National and other levels and
		with other voluntary organisation in these and similar programmes.</p>
	<p>
		<b>D. Lok Karya Kshetra</b>
	</p>
	<p>The Lok Karya Programme, or the public Co-operation scheme with
		the following objectives in view.</p>
	<p>i. To build up the inactive of people and the grouth of local
		leadership. ii. To augment the resources of the people. iii. To
		initiate projects which will increase the capacity of tyhe people
		(Production plants for families) iv. To mobilize man-power and
		resources to increase production, especially of food and v. To create
		an atmosphere and conditions in which people's institutions,
		particularly Co-operatives and panchayats, can function effectively.</p>
	<p>The programme is based on the basic assumption that
		"development" is a matter of attitude can be built up slowly but
		steadly through the subtle process of community organization. This
		involves understanding by the people of their own problems and
		undertaking to solve these in their humble way with the help of
		trained worker who helps asa catalytic agent or energizer. It is his
		part of the job to initiate the process and to unrture and develop it
		to frution.</p>
	<p>The ultimate aim, however, is to bring into full play the
		leadership of the people through their own institutions such as the
		Panchayat and Co-operative, so that an organisation is created at the
		village level which sustains the process initiated by the worker.</p>
	<p>
		<b>How a Kshetra Works</b>
	</p>
	<p>After the site for a lok Karya Kshetra has been selected, two
		full time are capable of and willing to render voluntary services for
		common village welfare, and to initiate the process of community
		organization. Usually a rough survey of the villages is also
		conducted.</p>
	<p>
		When they have known the area, its people, its workers and its leaders
		a little better, they proceed to form the village units and the
		Kshetra managing committee, takes upon himself the responsibility of
		liiking after the day-to-day affairs of the Kshetra. The Kshetra
		managing committee meets once in a month to conduct business. At this
		time the work of the Sahyogis is reviewed, problems of the area in
		solving which the Kshetra has to participate are discussed and
		important matters which the Central and Pradesh Offices point out are
		considered. Under the broad policy laid down, this committee is
		empowered to take any decision with regard to the Kshetra. As and when
		the need arses the committee also constitutes some-committees for
		special purposes. Till such time as a proper Kshetra managing
		committee is formed. An adhoc committee and a convener are appointed
		to perform its functions. Activities It is in the nature of the
		programme that the workers cannot initiate ambitious projects. They
		can undertake only small but significant projects which involve little
		or no expense on the part of the people but give them a chance to rub
		their shoulders in a common endeavour. Thus, activities undertaken in
		the Lok Karya Kshetras with the help of the workers can be categorized
		as follows: i. Educational and promotional: This aim at making people
		more plan-conscious and plan-minded by holding seminars and study
		camps on plants, and discussions in large and small groups. If the
		kshetra in a C. D. Block, efforts are also made to help the Block
		personnel in motivating people to undertake projects according to the
		plan of the Block. ii. Local project with local resources: These
		include project like the construction or repair of approach roads,
		pavament of village lanes, rapair and construction of village wells,
		constraction of community centres. iii. Development of local
		institutions: Due importance is given to the institutions of the
		village like the Panchayat, the Co-operative and School and at a later
		stage develop organisations for women, youth and children. iv.
		Emergency relief: This includes relief activities undertaken during
		the times of national calamities like flood, drought etc. and other
		accidents which need immediate relief. <b>E. Janjagaran</b> A
		wide-spread understanding of the plan is an essential stage in its
		fulfilment. It helps large number of persons to appreciate the main
		lines on which development is expected to proceed in the coming years.
		They will be able to see how progress in different directions is
		interrelated and effort in one field strengthen as well as demands
		efforts in other fields. The plan, therefore, is to be carried into
		every home in language and symbols of people and expressed in terms of
		their common needs and problems. The Government machinery alone,
		however high and mighty, cannot expect to do all what is desired to be
		done in every social activity. The primary purpose of the Jan Jagran
		Group is to build up popular enthusiasm for the plan, to inclucate
		national discipline and to mobilize public cooperation to implement
		the plan. The most effective medium for this purpose is the human
		medium. The group, through its whole time and associate workers, has
		been bulding up national network whereby, thrugh personal approach,
		its massage can reach the masses. The group has been discharging its
		responsibilities through(I) District Information Organisers(ii) Plan
		Information Centres and (iii) Seminars. The responsibilities of
		District Information Organizer and activities in Plan Information
		Centre are listed below. <b>District Information Organizers</b> 1.
